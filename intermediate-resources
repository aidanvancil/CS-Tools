In order to determine what DB language your query is, try to create a DB error using string concatenation. If the inject is blind and error handling is enabled from a DB's end it is worth considering the website hosting provider, framework, or what language the web application is written in. Usually: asp.NET = MSSQL, PHP = MySQL. String concatenation, if the inject is blind and no data is returned, can tell us what language. MSSQL and DB2 use + for string concatenation, whereas Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL use ||.
